    "description": "A gunman snuck through the backyard of a Queen Anne home, evading security lights to approach a basement window. Inside, Thomas Wales, a Seattle federal prosecutor and anti-gun violence advocate, worked on his computer. The gunman fired several shots at the unsuspecting Wales, killing him. Wales was survived by an adult son and daughter.\n\nFederal and local agencies launched an investigation into Wales’ death. If Wales was ultimately killed because of his work, he would be the first federal prosecutor in U.S. history to be slain in the line of duty.",

Still, investigators had managed to eliminate dozens of potential suspects – but not the Bellevue pilot, who had emerged as the prime suspect.\n\nHowever, the evidence implicating the pilot – who had refused to be interrogated – was considered circumstantial. And the pilot’s supporters argued that he had been targeted by FBI agents who had bungled the case.\n",

I agreed to pursue the matter, hell, I was going bankrupt. . . . \n\nI drove to the address, and then parked some distance away, north of downtown. I kind of camped out in the backyard of this house, and waited for the guy to settle in at his computer. Once he was there, I took careful aim. I shot two or possibly more times, and watched him collapse. I absurdly waited a few minutes and then left. I was sure he was dead. \n\nRetracing my steps, I dropped off the gun, found my money, and returned to Vegas. I feel bad about it, but I needed the money, and there were no witnesses.",
